In college, she started doing medical missions in the Dominican Republic every summer. During the pandemic, her practice adjusted to meet patients' needs by opening a telemedicine clinic. She realized that telemedicine has the potential to bring medical care to anyone, anywhere. Her passion for medical missions awakened a desire to use telemedicine as a resource to bring medical care to areas that have minimal access to healthcare. Driven by the love of Jesus, she hopes to change lives internationally by equipping people with the tools they need to live a healthy life.</p>
