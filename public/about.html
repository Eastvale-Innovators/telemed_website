        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Established in March of 2023, the poor health services due to
          inadequate health workers and lack of medical supplies in Kwale County
          inspired us to begin our journey in paving the way for a healthier
          future.

        <h2>How It Started</h2>
        <p>
          Virtual Medical Missions was a dream birthed out of the desire to
          provide long term medical access to areas of the world that do not
          have proper health care. The CEO of VMM presented this vision to the
          Innovators Club at Eastvale STEM Academy in March of 2023, and they
          soon partnered with this dream. Teams of computer science students,
          engineering students, and pre-medical students joined together to
          build an online platform that would allow VMM to provide E-visits and
          telemedicine encounters to underserved patients worldwide. These
          brilliant minds have collaborated with the physicians and board
          members of VMM to create our web portal that serves patients
          internationally.

        <h2>VMM collaboration with eSTEM and Eastvale Innovators</h2>
        <p>
          When the mentors of VMM envisioned a mission of such caliber, they
          immediately thought of eSTEM as the place where their vision would be
          fulfilled. The Eastvale Stem Academy was built with one purpose, to
          educate students and provide real world experience in pathways related
          to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine. With collaboration,
          critical thinking, communication and creativity being the 4 main
          tenets of eSTEM, stem students immediately set out to work on the
          mission helping the people of the Kwale County in Godo, Kenya. Having
          students coming from an engineering, medical and computer science
          background along with the resources provided at eSTEM, such as the
          medical/engineering lab.
