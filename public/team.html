              Tiffany Peraino, the founder of Virtual Medical Missions, has had
              a heart for medical missions since she was a young child. In
              college, she started doing medical missions in Dominican Republic
              every summer. During the pandemic, her practice adjusted to meet
              patients needs by opening a telemedicine clinic. She realized that
              telemedicine has the potential to bring medical care to anyone,
              anywhere. Her passion for medical missions awakened a desire to
              use telemedicine as a resource to bring medical care to areas that
              have minimal access to healthcare. Driven by the love of Jesus,
              she hopes to change lives internationally by equipping people with
              the tools they need to live a healthy life.

              involved in VMM as a part of the medical team. As a team leader,
              Jeethu has been helping the team research & compile lists of the
              diseases that our branching logics will ultimately diagnose as
              well as come up with questions to be embedded in the pathways.
              Hopeful about the possibilities & reach of this project, Jeethu is
              actively working to help leave a significant impact on the
              communities that use telemedicine in the future.

              High School. VMM has helped further educate her with her medical
              knowledge and putting what she has learnt into use to help serve
              many communities. As a member of this project, she has helped with
              the branching logic, interpreting data presented by other teams,
              and working with other teams to assist them in their findings.
              Adithi is extremely grateful to be a part of a team who wants to
